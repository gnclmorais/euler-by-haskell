# Euler by Haskell
Project Euler solutions using Haskell, for learning purposes.

> [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net) (named after Leonhard Euler) is a __website dedicated to a series of computational problems intended to be solved with computer programs__. The project attracts adults and students interested in mathematics and computer programming. Since its creation in 2001 by Colin Hughes, Project Euler has gained notability and popularity worldwide. It includes over 500 problems, with a new one added every weekend (except during the summer). Problems are of varying difficulty but each is solvable in less than a minute using an efficient algorithm on a modestly powered computer. A forum specific to each question may be viewed after the user has correctly answered the given question.
